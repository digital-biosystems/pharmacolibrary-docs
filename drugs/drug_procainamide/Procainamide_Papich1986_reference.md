# procainamide — `Procainamide_Papich1986_reference`

> ## <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span>

### Reviewer guidance

> ⚙️ **Pipeline limitation — fulltext.** the record was built from the abstract alone, so reported summary statistics stood in for a fitted model<br><sub>evidence: `provenance.source=abstract-only`</sub>

> This is not a curation fix: the record is waiting on the pipeline, not on a reviewer's judgement.

**What is wrong:** the engineer built the model but a core parameter had no value and was left at its base-class default, so it was not shipped; the engineer did not exercise the covariate scenarios this record defines. Evidence: T2_covariates_not_exercised.

**Steps:**
1. Not a curation fix — fulltext limitation.
2. Check _transcribev2.yaml for the parameter: if the paper's table carries the number, the interpret stage dropped it — re-run interpret and validate for the drug, then the engineer.
3. If the paper never reports it, the record cannot become a model.
4. Advisory only — the base model still replicates.
5. Check the record's covariate_definitions in _interpretv2.yaml.
6. Re-run the engineer for this drug if the covariate curves are wanted.

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="procainamide" model-id="Procainamide_Papich1986_reference" status="model_quarantined" stale="false" population="dogs" measured-compound="procainamide" parameterization="apparent" topology="parent_metabolite"></dbs-pgx>

**Parameterization:** V/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `model_quarantined`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- covariate category for t1/2z from footnote/prose kept as documentation only (['Papich_1986:abstract'])
- dropped duplicate Q57 ('estimated elimination half-life of NAPA', value 4.7) — already have one for this compound
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=procainamide
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- topology: transfer parameter unlinked (Q100) — add Kfm/formation-rate/rate-constant to the ontology; routing to review
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is PARENT_METABOLITE (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is PARENT_METABOLITE (peripheral family needs ≥2C)

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from abstract in Papich_1986_metadata.yaml (9 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model

| T3_apparent_invariant | not captured | pass | not captured | F=Fm=1, no molar correction | not captured | apparent params must not be double-corrected |
| T3_param_coverage | not captured | pass | 2 scholar param(s) emitted or defaulted | 2 covered | not captured | all structural parameters accounted for |
| T3_topology_template | not captured | pass | parent_metabolite → PK_Parent_Metabolite* | PK_Parent_Metabolite | not captured | engineer template must match the scholar topology |
