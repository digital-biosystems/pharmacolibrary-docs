### Reviewer guidance

**What is wrong:** the simulated model does not reproduce a value the paper reports. Evidence: T1_t_half_terminal — expected 1.0 — got 0.6774367969306797 — ratio 0.6774; T1_t_half_beta — expected 4.34 — got 0.6774367969306797 — ratio 0.1561; T1_t_half_terminal — expected 4.0 — got 0.6774367969306797 — ratio 0.1694

**Steps:**
1. Open the paper's reported table and confirm the target value and its units.
2. Compare with the transcribed value in _transcribev2.yaml for this stem.
3. If the transcription is right, the extracted parameters are suspect — check CL and volume in _interpretv2.yaml against the paper.
4. If the transcription is wrong, fix the extraction; the model rebuild follows.

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="cafedrine" model-id="Cafedrine_Dings2024_reference" status="needs_review" stale="false" population="patients under general anaesthesia" measured-compound="cafedrine" parameterization="mechanistic" topology="1C"></dbs-pgx>

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `needs_review`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=cafedrine
- gap-filled Q22 (CL) from Dings_2026's review values (primary lacked it)
- gap-filled Q61 (V) from Dings_2026's review values (primary lacked it)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)

**Extraction notes:**
- no TEI final-model table id; trying text-pointer table recovery
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2
- text-pointer recovery found no readable extracted parameter table
