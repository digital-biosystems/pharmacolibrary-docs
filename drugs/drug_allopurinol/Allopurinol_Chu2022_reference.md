# allopurinol — `Allopurinol_Chu2022_reference`

> ## <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span>

### Reviewer guidance

> ⚙️ **Pipeline limitation — engineer.** parent/metabolite records are not currently produced as models — the composite builds but does not survive simulation<br><sub>evidence: `topology_template=parent_metabolite`</sub>

> This is not a curation fix: the record is waiting on the pipeline, not on a reviewer's judgement.

**What is wrong:** no model exists yet, so there is nothing to judge.

**Steps:**
1. Not a curation fix — engineer limitation.
2. No curator action. Run the engineer for this drug.

<summary>Column legend — what each column means</summary>
<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>label (paper)</code></td><td>the row or statistic label exactly as printed in the paper (label_verbatim) — never normalised, so it can be found in the PDF.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Q-code · name</code></td><td>the ontology parameter this label was matched to (Q22 = clearance, Q27 = CL/F, Q49 = ka, Q57 = half-life, …) and its canonical name. The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit. Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit_canonical</code></td><td>the canonical unit for that Q-code, i.e. what value_si is expressed in.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RSE%</code></td><td>relative standard error of the estimate, when the paper reports one.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><td><code>covariates</code></td><td>covariate effects attached to this parameter (e.g. weight on CL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>IIV</code></td><td>inter-individual variability reported for this parameter.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.

### Unresolved rows _(no Q-code or no value — not parameters)_
| label (paper) | Q-code | value | link |
|---|---|---|---|
| Allopurinol clearance (CL1) | Q22 | not captured | llm_confirmed |

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'CL1' (CL)
- dropped value-less row: 'Allopurinol volume of distribution (V1)' (captured trailing unit 'V1' for child rows)
- unit 'V1' inherited from a section-header row for CL (not printed on this row itself) — see the unit_dimension_mismatch check below if this is wrong
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'V1' (CL)
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('Oxypurinol clearance (CL2)a', value None) — already have one for this compound
- dropped value-less row: 'Oxypurinol volume of distribution (V2)a'
- dropped PD-category row 'Oxypurinol concentration with 50% of maximum effect on CL1 (IC50auto)' → Q322 (IC50, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['Tab3:row6:col1', 'Tab3:row6:col2'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=allopurinol
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- gap-filled Q61 (V) from Aksenov_2018's review values (primary lacked it)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is PARENT_METABOLITE (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is PARENT_METABOLITE (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- gap-filled Q49 (kabs) from Ekobena_2025's review values (primary lacked it)
- gap-filled Q83 (tlag) from Ekobena_2025's review values (primary lacked it)

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell Tab3:row2:col1 = '2.43 L'
- unparsed cell Tab3:row4:col1 = '11 L'
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 3

| T3_output_variable | not captured | pass | Metabolite_C (measured=allopurinol) | Metabolite_C | not captured | output must be the measured/analyte compartment |
| T3_param_coverage | not captured | skipped | not captured | not captured | not captured | no emitted model to inspect (engineer build absent) |
| T6_deviations | not captured | pass | not captured | not captured | not captured | no engineer deviations to adjudicate |

## Web simulation

> 🚧 Not yet wired up — this tab will host an in-browser run of the model above, with editable parameters and dosing.

The simulator will be built on **bodylight.js**, which compiles a model to WebAssembly and drives it from the page, so a simulation runs entirely in the browser with nothing to install: <https://bodylight.physiome.cz/>
