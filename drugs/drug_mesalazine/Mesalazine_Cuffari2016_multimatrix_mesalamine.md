<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

### Reviewer guidance

**Why:** the engineer built the model but a core parameter had no value and was left at its base-class default, so it was not shipped
**Second reading:** `gpt-oss:120b` read this paper differently on `parameters[% dose absorbed, mean]` (22.1 vs not captured) — not a structural parameter.
**How to address:** Check _transcribev2.yaml for the parameter: if the paper's table carries the number, the interpret stage dropped it — re-run interpret and validate for the drug, then the engineer.
<sub>owner: **scholar**</sub>

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `mesalazine`, measured `5-ASA`.

<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>label (paper)</code></td><td>the row or statistic label exactly as printed in the paper (label_verbatim) — never normalised, so it can be found in the PDF.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Q-code · name</code></td><td>the ontology parameter this label was matched to (Q22 = clearance, Q27 = CL/F, Q49 = ka, Q57 = half-life, …) and its canonical name.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): '30 mg/kg/day, n=21' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Cuffari_2016_table_2:row0:col1', 'Cuffari_2016_table_2:row0:col2'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'AUCss (µg×h/L), mean (SD)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Cuffari_2016_table_2:row2:col1', 'Cuffari_2016_table_2:row2:col2', 'Cuffari_2016_table_2:row2:col3', 'Cuffari_2016_table_2:row9:col1', 'Cuffari_2016_table_2:row9:col2', 'Cuffari_2016_table_2:row9:col3'])

- table mostly unlinked (8/8 table-cell rows NIL) — likely the wrong table was located, not 0 genuinely-missing ontology parameter(s); route_to_review instead of building a model from the residual linked cell(s)
- salvaged Q22 ('apparent metabolic clearance'=85.6) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q61 ('central volume of distribution'=109) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=5-ASA
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'multimatrix mesalamine' subgroup of Cuffari_2016 (paper reports 2 populations: multimatrix mesalamine, nonmem estimates)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is PARENT_METABOLITE (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is PARENT_METABOLITE (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
