<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

### Reviewer guidance

**Why:** the engineer built the model but a core parameter had no value and was left at its base-class default, so it was not shipped; the model was built differently from what the record describes; the engineer's deviations are not documented and quantified. Evidence: T3_param_coverage — expected 4 scholar param(s) emitted or defaulted — got 2 covered; T3_topology_template — expected parent_metabolite → PK_Parent_Metabolite* — got PK_1C_enteral; T6_deviations — got invented_absorption: not acceptable.
**Second reading:** `gpt-oss:120b` read this paper differently on `screen.dose_compound` (dabrafenib vs dabrafenib, trametinib) and 1 more field(s) — a structural parameter, so the record is disputed.
**How to address:** not a curation fix — the pipeline is the limit here (scholar: a reported unit is missing from the conversion table, so the parameter reached the engineer without an SI value).

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Parameters' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_2:row0:col2'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=dabrafenib
