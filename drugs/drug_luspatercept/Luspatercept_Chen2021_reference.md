<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
</details>

> **Caveat** (`covariates_not_exercised`): the record defines covariate effects (weight on clearance, renal function …) but the engineer simulated only the reference individual, so those scenarios were never run. The base model still reproduces the paper; what is missing is the covariate curves.

### Reviewer guidance

**Why:** T6_deviations
**Second reading:** Independently confirmed by `gpt-oss:120b`.
**How to address:** Read the .deviation.json and confirm each deviation names what changed and why.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['ka', 'Tlag']
- `apparent_assumption`: F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction (parameterization=apparent)
- `invented_absorption`: ka defaulted — not reported in source

**Interpretation flags:**
- covariate level 'Weight, kg on CL/F' → Q900:weight_kg_on_cl_f = 0.809 (linear_fractional on Q27)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'RBCT burden (units/24 weeks) on CL/F' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['jcph1696-tbl-0002:row7:col1', 'jcph1696-tbl-0002:row7:col2'])
- covariate level 'Albumin, g/L on CL/F' → Q900:albumin_g_l_on_cl_f = -0.886 (linear_fractional on Q27)
- covariate level 'Weight, kg on V1/F' → Q900:weight_kg_on_v1_f = 0.718 (linear_fractional on Q27)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'RBCT burden (units/24 weeks) on V1/F' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['jcph1696-tbl-0002:row10:col1', 'jcph1696-tbl-0002:row10:col2'])
- routed 'Interindividual variability of CL/F (%)' → Q312 (IIV) to iiv — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- routed 'Interindividual variability of V1/F (%)' → Q312 (IIV) to iiv — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=luspatercept
- 1C volume normalization: Q290→Q76 (single-compartment model has no central/peripheral split; 'V1/F, L' is the general volume)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
