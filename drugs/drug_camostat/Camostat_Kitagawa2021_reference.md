# camostat — `Camostat_Kitagawa2021_reference`

> ## <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span>

### Reviewer guidance

**What is wrong:** a compartment is unreachable, or a metabolite is unlinked

**Steps:**
1. Check the record's links in _interpretv2.yaml — every compartment needs a path to the dosed one.
2. Parent/metabolite records commonly miss the formation link.

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `camostat mesylate`, measured `GBPA`.

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="camostat" model-id="Camostat_Kitagawa2021_reference" status="rejected" stale="false" population="healthy adults" measured-compound="GBPA" parameterization="apparent" topology="2C"></dbs-pgx>

**Parameterization:** apparent.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — parameter **values are suppressed**. Labels, links and provenance shown for audit only.

_No resolved parameters._

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- $THETA(13) has no $PK binding — index may be misassigned
- $THETA(15) has no $PK binding — index may be misassigned
- control_stream ADVAN4 TRANS4: topology=2C, parameterization=apparent (clearance)
- theta_crosscheck: table present but its labels did not align to bound THETAs (skipped)
- structure disagreement: deterministic 2C vs LLM 1C — review compartment count
- gap-filled Q49 (kabs) from Kosinsky_2022's review values (primary lacked it)
- removed gap-filled parent disposition (Q49): this record measures 'GBPA', not camostat, and reports no metabolite CL/V — the imported values describe a compartment this record did not measure

## Validation

**Scholar closed-form checks:**

| check | status | expected | obtained | ratio | tol | source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C0_has_structural_params | pass | not captured | 1 | not captured | not captured | not captured |
| C0b_disposition_core | fail | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured |
| C5_dimension_Q49 | pass | 1 / [time] | not captured | not captured | not captured | ['Kosinsky_2022:review'] |
| C7_apparent_coherence | pass | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured |
| C8_topology | fail | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured |

## Web simulation

> 🚧 Not yet wired up — this tab will host an in-browser run of the model above, with editable parameters and dosing.

The simulator will be built on **bodylight.js**, which compiles a model to WebAssembly and drives it from the page, so a simulation runs entirely in the browser with nothing to install: <https://bodylight.physiome.cz/>
