# rosiglitazone — `Rosiglitazone_Gao2012_estimate_cv`

> ## <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span>

### Reviewer guidance

> ⚙️ **Pipeline limitation — scholar.** a reported unit is missing from the conversion table, so the parameter reached the engineer without an SI value<br><sub>evidence: `kabs`</sub>

> This is not a curation fix: the record is waiting on the pipeline, not on a reviewer's judgement.

**What is wrong:** the engineer built the model but a core parameter had no value and was left at its base-class default, so it was not shipped; the engineer's deviations are not documented and quantified. Evidence: T6_deviations — got defaulted_parameters: structural deviation not quantified; invented_absorption: not acceptable.

**Steps:**
1. Not a curation fix — scholar limitation.
2. Check _transcribev2.yaml for the parameter: if the paper's table carries the number, the interpret stage dropped it — re-run interpret and validate for the drug, then the engineer.
3. If the paper never reports it, the record cannot become a model.
4. Read the .deviation.json and confirm each deviation names what changed and why.
5. Anything undocumented needs the engineer, not a curator.

<dbs-pgx drug="rosiglitazone" model-id="Rosiglitazone_Gao2012_estimate_cv" status="model_quarantined" stale="false" population="type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats" measured-compound="rosiglitazone" parameterization="apparent" topology="1C"></dbs-pgx>

**Parameterization:** V/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `model_quarantined`) — parameter **values are suppressed**. Labels, links and provenance shown for audit only.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped value-less row: 'S_G, dl/mg'
- dropped value-less row: 'k_dis'
- dropped value-less row: 'k_el,P, day-1'
- dropped value-less row: 'k_0,P, kg/mg/day'
- dropped value-less row: 'k_00, day-1'
- dropped value-less row: 'S_R, kg/mg'
- dropped value-less row: 'IC_50, µg/ml'
- dropped value-less row: 'I_max'
- dropped value-less row: 'k_T, day-1'
- dropped value-less row: 'ID_50P, mg/kg'
- dropped value-less row: 'ID_50wt, mg/kg'
- salvaged Q49 ('k a'=2.01) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q76 ('V/F'=342) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=rosiglitazone
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'estimate (cv%)' subgroup of Gao_2012 (paper reports 2 populations: definition, estimate (cv%))

**Extraction notes:**
- no TEI final-model table id; trying text-pointer table recovery
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 3
- unparsed cell Gao_2012_table_3:row2:col2 = '4.02, 2.83, 3.28b'
- unparsed cell Gao_2012_table_3:row3:col2 = '271, 260, 238b'
- unparsed cell Gao_2012_table_3:row10:col1 = 'Concentration for 50% of glucose inhibitory effect'

| T3_topology_template | not captured | pass | 1C → PK_1C* | PK_1C_enteral | not captured | engineer template must match the scholar topology |
| T6_deviations | not captured | fail | not captured | defaulted_parameters: structural deviation not quantified; invented_absorption: not acceptable | not captured | LLM adjudication → deterministic rule |
