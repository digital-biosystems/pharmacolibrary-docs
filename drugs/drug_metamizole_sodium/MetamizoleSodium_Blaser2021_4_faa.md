The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit. Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit_canonical</code></td><td>the canonical unit for that Q-code, i.e. what value_si is expressed in.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RSE%</code></td><td>relative standard error of the estimate, when the paper reports one.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><td><code>covariates</code></td><td>covariate effects attached to this parameter (e.g. weight on CL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>IIV</code></td><td>inter-individual variability reported for this parameter.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- column '4-faa' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- column '4-faa' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- salvaged Q22 ('average inulin clearance in our study was approximately'=20) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=4-methylaminoantipyrine
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- topology: 4 first-order transfer(s) across 5 compounds → general_linear
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: '4-faa' subgroup of Blaser_2021 (paper reports 6 populations: 4-aa, 4-aaa, 4-faa, 4-maa, metamizole (n = 8), naproxen (n = 7))

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell T3:row6:col3 = '16.8 ± 5.58a'
- unparsed cell T3:row16:col3 = '0.028 ± 0.004a'
- unparsed cell T3:row19:col3 = '22.10 ± 1.32a'
- unparsed cell T3:row20:col2 = 'EC50 (µM)'
- unparsed cell T3:row22:col2 = 'E0'
- companion parameter table 2 transcribed (8 record(s))
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2, 3

## Validation

**Scholar closed-form checks:**

| check | status | expected | obtained | ratio | tol | source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C0_has_structural_params | pass | not captured | 3 | not captured | not captured | not captured |
| C0b_disposition_core | pass | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured |
| C6_cl_magnitude | pass | &lt;= 90.0 L/h | 20.0 | not captured | not captured | ['Blaser_2021:discussion_prose'] |
| C8_topology | fail | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured |
| C9_phys_window_Q22 | pass | clearance within physiological range | 1.2 L/h | not captured | not captured | ['Blaser_2021:discussion_prose'] |

<summary>Check legend — what each column means</summary>
<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>check</code></td><td>the check id. C0_has_structural_params = at least one numeric structural parameter; C0b_disposition_core = both a volume and a clearance/elimination term; C1_half_life(_beta) = reported half-life against V and CL; C2_reference = covariate scenarios are sign-plausible; C3_cl_dose_auc = CL against dose/AUC; C4_auc_closed_form = AUC recomputed in closed form; C5_dimension_&lt;Qcode&gt; = the parameter's units carry the dimension its Q-code requires.</td></tr><tr><td><code>status</code></td><td>pass, fail, or skipped. A skipped check had nothing to compare — the paper did not report the input it needs — and is not evidence against the record. The scholar table lists only pass and fail; the reviewer table also shows skipped, with the reason in note.</td></tr><tr><td><code>expected</code></td><td>the value the check required, from the paper or from the ontology.</td></tr><tr><td><code>obtained</code></td><td>what the record actually yields.</td></tr><tr><td><code>ratio</code></td><td>obtained / expected, where the check is a numeric comparison.</td></tr><tr><td><code>tol</code></td><td>the tolerance the ratio had to fall within to pass.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>the artifact the expected value was taken from.</td></tr><tr><td><code>scenario</code></td><td>reviewer table only — the covariate scenario the check was run under.</td></tr><tr><td><code>note</code></td><td>why a check was skipped, or how it was judged.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.

## Web simulation

> 🚧 Not yet wired up — this tab will host an in-browser run of the model above, with editable parameters and dosing.

The simulator will be built on **bodylight.js**, which compiles a model to WebAssembly and drives it from the page, so a simulation runs entirely in the browser with nothing to install: <https://bodylight.physiome.cz/>
