### Reviewer guidance

**What is wrong:** no model exists yet, so there is nothing to judge

**Steps:**
1. No curator action. Run the engineer for this drug.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4
- gap-filled Q22 (CL) from Goutelle_2022's review values (primary lacked it)
- gap-filled Q61 (V) from Haefliger_2025's review values (primary lacked it)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available, and no PDF or abstract text to fall back on

**Reviewer per-scenario checks:**

| T3_output_variable | not captured | pass | C_central (measured=hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4) | central.C | not captured | output must be the measured/analyte compartment |
| T3_param_coverage | not captured | skipped | not captured | not captured | not captured | no emitted model to inspect (engineer build absent) |

## Downloadable models

Each archive holds the model source, a script that simulates it against the appropriate library, and a README describing both and how to run them.

**FMI is two downloads.** The archive holds this record's parameters and its driver; the simulator itself is `PK_1C.fmu`, one compiled template shared by every model of this structure. Take the FMU once, keep it beside the script (or pass `--fmu PATH`). Running it reproduces the model-specific FMU exactly.

## Web simulation

> 🚧 Not yet wired up — this tab will host an in-browser run of the model above, with editable parameters and dosing.

The simulator will be built on **bodylight.js**, which compiles a model to WebAssembly and drives it from the page, so a simulation runs entirely in the browser with nothing to install: <https://bodylight.physiome.cz/>
