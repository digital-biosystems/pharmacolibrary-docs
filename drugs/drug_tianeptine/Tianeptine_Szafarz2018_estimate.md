<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

### Reviewer guidance

**Why:** C2_reference failed (ratio None).
**Second reading:** `gpt-oss:120b` read this paper differently on `parameters[v m/f m].parameter_id` (Q352 vs Q61) — a structural parameter, so the record is disputed.
**How to address:** not a curation fix — the pipeline is the limit here (reviewer_tooling: the check reported a failure without computing a comparison, so this is an inconclusive check rather than a demonstrated fault).

- population split: 'estimate' subgroup of Szafarz_2018 (paper reports 3 populations: estimate, intraperitoneal 10 mg/kg, intravenous 1 mg/kg)
