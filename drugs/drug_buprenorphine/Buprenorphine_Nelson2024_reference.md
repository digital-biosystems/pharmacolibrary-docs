# buprenorphine — `Buprenorphine_Nelson2024_reference`

> ## <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span>

### Reviewer guidance

> ⚙️ **Pipeline limitation — scholar.** a reported unit is missing from the conversion table, so the parameter reached the engineer without an SI value<br><sub>evidence: `Cmax`, `tmax`, `AUC`</sub>

> This is not a curation fix: the record is waiting on the pipeline, not on a reviewer's judgement.

**What is wrong:** no model exists yet, so there is nothing to judge.

**Steps:**
1. Not a curation fix — scholar limitation.
2. No curator action. Run the engineer for this drug.

The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit. Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit_canonical</code></td><td>the canonical unit for that Q-code, i.e. what value_si is expressed in.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RSE%</code></td><td>relative standard error of the estimate, when the paper reports one.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><td><code>covariates</code></td><td>covariate effects attached to this parameter (e.g. weight on CL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>IIV</code></td><td>inter-individual variability reported for this parameter.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'ng mL e1' (Cmax)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'hours ng mL e1' (AUC)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=buprenorphine
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted

## Validation

**Scholar closed-form checks:**

| check | status | expected | obtained | ratio | tol | source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C0_has_structural_params | pass | not captured | 3 | not captured | not captured | not captured |
| C5_dimension_Q56 | pass | [time] | not captured | not captured | not captured | ['tab_0:row4:col2', 'tab_0:row4:col3', 'tab_0:row4:col4'] |
| C8_topology | pass | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured |

**Reviewer per-scenario checks:**

| check | scenario | status | expected | obtained | ratio | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T2_covariates | not captured | skipped | not captured | not captured | not captured | no covariate effects in record |
| T3_param_coverage | not captured | skipped | not captured | not captured | not captured | no structural disposition parameters in record |
| T6_deviations | not captured | pass | not captured | not captured | not captured | no engineer deviations to adjudicate |

## Web simulation

> 🚧 Not yet wired up — this tab will host an in-browser run of the model above, with editable parameters and dosing.

The simulator will be built on **bodylight.js**, which compiles a model to WebAssembly and drives it from the page, so a simulation runs entirely in the browser with nothing to install: <https://bodylight.physiome.cz/>
