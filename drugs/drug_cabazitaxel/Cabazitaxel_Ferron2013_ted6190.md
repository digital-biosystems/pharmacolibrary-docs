<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**CL, V and Vss have no unit; the model does not reproduce the paper's terminal half-life (model/paper ratio 0.198).**

Without a unit the value cannot be converted, so the model cannot use it. Simulated as the paper dosed it, the model's terminal half-life differs from the value the paper reports by more than the tolerance. A reported unit could not be converted (CL, V and Vss), so that value has no SI equivalent. Extracted — cabazitaxel: CL 24.2 n = 35, V 10.8 n = 35, Vss 2.71e+03 n = 35, t1/2α 2.85 min, t1/2β 1.57 h, t1/2γ 103 h.

Independently confirmed by `gpt-oss-120b`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'n = 35' (CL)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'n = 35' (V1)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'n = 35' (Vss)
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'NIL' from footnote/prose loose number 170 (source ['Tab4:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- implicit units: 'CL, L/h/m2' — the LLM proposed 'L/h/m2', whose dimension does not fit Q22; left unset
- implicit units: 'V1, L/m2' — the LLM proposed 'L/m2', whose dimension does not fit Q63; left unset
- implicit units: 'V ss, L/m²' — the LLM proposed 'L/m2', whose dimension does not fit Q65; left unset
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=cabazitaxel
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 3C — review compartment count
- 1C volume normalization: Q63→Q61 (single-compartment model has no central/peripheral split; 'V1, L/m2' is the general volume)
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'ted6190(n = 35)' subgroup of Ferron_2013 (paper reports 6 populations: all(n = 170), ard6191(n = 34), efc6193(n = 67), ted6188(n = 21), ted6189(n = 13), ted6190(n = 35))

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell Tab4:row1:col3 = '95 % CI (lower)'
- unparsed cell Tab4:row1:col4 = '95 % CI (upper)'
- transposed table Ferron_2013_table_5: parameters were across the columns, populations/subgroups down the first column — transposed for parsing
- companion parameter table 5 transcribed (36 record(s))
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 4, 5

A record can have several readers.</td></tr><tr><td><code>agreement</code></td><td>share of the compared fields that reader agreed on.</td></tr><tr><td><code>verdict</code></td><td>per reader: `confirmed` it agrees throughout · `partly confirmed` a non-structural field differs · `not confirmed` a structural one differs (clearance, a volume, ka, a lag) · `primary re-run` the first reading extracted nothing and was given one hinted retry.</td></tr><tr><td><code>combined</code></td><td>the record's verdict over ALL its readers: confirmed only when every reader that answered agrees, disputed as soon as one disagrees on a structural parameter. The most favourable reading is never taken — an extra reader must not be a way to find one that agrees.</td></tr><tr><td><code>kept</code></td><td>which reading the record holds.
