<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
</details>

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**Every check that could be run on this record passed.**

Only the abstract was available, so reported summary statistics stand in for a fitted model.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss-120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has trastuzumab emtansine, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 9 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit. Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit_canonical</code></td><td>the canonical unit for that Q-code, i.e. what value_si is expressed in.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RSE%</code></td><td>relative standard error of the estimate, when the paper reports one.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><td><code>covariates</code></td><td>covariate effects attached to this parameter (e.g. weight on CL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>IIV</code></td><td>inter-individual variability reported for this parameter.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded. This is NOT the same as zero or empty: the value is unknown, not measured to be nothing.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—</code></td><td>deliberately not shown: the column does not apply to this row.</td></tr><tr><td><code>not verified</code></td><td>the record is not in an accepted state (see the badge and the note above the table); the numbers are shown as extracted, not endorsed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=trastuzumab emtansine
- molar mass: none found for 'trastuzumab_emtansine' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- molar mass: none found for 'trastuzumab emtansine' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from abstract in Gupta_2012_metadata.yaml (4 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model
