## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Salbutamol (concentrations from this paper's PK model) drives Blood glucose (in mmol/l): direct sigmoid Emax (Hill) effect.

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

> Salbutamol plasma concentrations (ng/ml) were linked to blood glucose in a sequential population PKPD analysis with a stimulatory Emax model (direct concentration-effect relationship); the paper states blood glucose increased with salbutamol concentration and that the effect was independent of corticosteroids, but it does not report the glucose Emax, EC50, Hill coefficient or any turnover/kin-kout parameters.

- **paper:** `Walsh_2023`
- **model family:** `sigmoid_emax`

Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.

## Exposure-response model

`Salbutamol_Walsh2023_PD_glucose` — sigmoid_emax, `response = E0 + Emax*frac`

| parameter | value (paper units) | SI |
|---|---|---|
| E0 | 5.03 mmol/l | 5.03 mol/m3 |
| Emax | 3.86 mmol/l | 3.86 mol/m3 |
| EC50 | 1.08 ng/ml | 1.08e-06 kg/m3 |
| gamma | 1 | — |

Closed-form check points (response, SI): `at_0` = 5.03, `at_EC50` = 6.96, `at_inf` = 8.89

Deviations:

- `defaulted_parameters` — gamma

## Review

Verdict <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">accepted (caveats)</span>

| check | status | note |
|---|---|---|
| `T0_driver` | pass | driver is the drug, a synonym or one of its metabolites (or unnamed) |
| `T1_closed_form` | pass | engineer's check points reproduced from the bound parameters |
| `T1b_fmu` | pass | shared PD_SigmoidEmaxSweep FMU reproduces the reference points (worst 0.03%) |
| `T2_direction` | pass | the response rises, as direct effect predicts |
| `T3_plausibility` | pass | EC50, gamma, Imax and baseline in range |
| `T4_defaults` | advisory | only convention defaults (gamma = 1) |

Advisory:

- defaulted: gamma (convention)
