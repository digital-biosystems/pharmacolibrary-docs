# glyceryl trinitrate — `GlycerylTrinitrate_Lee1990_reference`

> ## <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span>

### Reviewer guidance

> ⚙️ **Pipeline limitation — fulltext.** the record was built from the abstract alone, so reported summary statistics stood in for a fitted model<br><sub>evidence: `provenance.source=abstract-only`</sub>

> This is not a curation fix: the record is waiting on the pipeline, not on a reviewer's judgement.

**What is wrong:** every check the reviewer could run passed.

**Steps:**
1. Not a curation fix — fulltext limitation.
2. Confirm the model card and promote to 'curated' if it should be an exemplar. Promotion is a human decision; the reviewer never makes it.

**Parameterization:** CL/F, V/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped value-less row: 'apparent fractional GTN clearances to 1,2-GDN (CLapp,m1)' (captured trailing unit 'CLapp,m1' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'apparent fractional GTN clearances to 1,3-GDN (CLapp,m2)' (captured trailing unit 'CLapp,m2' for child rows)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'GTN doses' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Lee_1990:abstract'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'high i.v.' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Lee_1990:abstract'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=glyceryl_trinitrate
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- topology: 2 first-order transfer(s) across 3 compounds → general_linear
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model
- gap-filled Q76 (V/F) from Kielbasa_2019's review values (primary lacked it)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is GENERAL_LINEAR (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is GENERAL_LINEAR (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- gap-filled Q49 (kabs) from Kielbasa_2019's review values (primary lacked it)

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from abstract in Lee_1990_metadata.yaml (7 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model
