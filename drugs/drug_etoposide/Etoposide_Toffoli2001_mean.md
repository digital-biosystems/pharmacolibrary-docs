A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**No value for etoposide's clearance.**

The model was built, but etoposide's clearance had no value, so a library placeholder stood in and the model was held back rather than published with an invented number. A reported unit could not be converted (CL, k12 and k21), so that value has no SI equivalent. Extracted — etoposide: CL 1.14 l h x1, V 6 l, k12 0.14 h x1, k21 0.06 h x1, Fab 0.44.

<sub>reviewed by rule template (no LLM)</sub>

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `model_quarantined` (reviewed 2026-09-28 14:37:58.673901+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-07 18:12:06.616813+00:00). Current validate status: `extracted`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'l h x1' (CL)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'h x1' (k12)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'h x1' (k21)
- implicit units: 'CL (l h x1 )' → L/h (from the paper text: "Abstract states: 'Mean clearance was 1.14 l h x1' and section 'In¯uence of renal function and ageing on clearance' prese")
- implicit units: 'k 12 (h x1 )' → 1/h (from the popPK convention: 'k12 is a first-order rate constant; by PK convention these are expressed in reciprocal time (1/h). The value 0.14 is con')
- implicit units: 'k 21 (h x1 )' → 1/h (from the popPK convention: 'k21 is a first-order rate constant; by PK convention these are expressed in reciprocal time (1/h). The value 0.06 is con')
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=etoposide
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 2C — review compartment count
- population split: 'mean' subgroup of Toffoli_2001 (paper reports 2 populations: mean, mean with covariables)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2
