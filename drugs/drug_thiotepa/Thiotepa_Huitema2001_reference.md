## Population and dosing

**Population:** patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy · condition cancer · age group adult · n = 40.

## Model

**Structure:** parent + metabolite; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameterization:** mechanistic.  
**Parameters:** 0 extracted.  
**Availability:** No model was generated from this record.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ Status "Rejected": these are the values as extracted, **not verified**. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

_No resolved parameters._

### Reviewer guidance

**The paper reports none of the model's key parameters.**

No clearance, volume or rate constant of the model is reported in it. Only the abstract was available, so reported summary statistics stand in for a fitted model. No parameter values were extracted.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss-120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has thiotepa, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 1 more field. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- table section iiv: 'Clearance of thioTEPA (CL)' routed out of structural estimates ('Clearance of thioTEPA (CL) was 34 l x h(-1) with an IIV and IOV of 18 and 11%, respectively.')
- table section iiv: 'volume of distribution of thioTEPA' routed out of structural estimates ('Clearance of thioTEPA (CL) was 34 l x h(-1) with an IIV and IOV of 18 and 11%, respectively.')
- table section iiv: 'fraction of thioTEPA converted to TEPA divided by the volume of distribution of TEPA' routed out of structural estimates ('Clearance of thioTEPA (CL) was 34 l x h(-1) with an IIV and IOV of 18 and 11%, respectively.')
- table section iiv: 'elimination rate constant of TEPA' routed out of structural estimates ('Clearance of thioTEPA (CL) was 34 l x h(-1) with an IIV and IOV of 18 and 11%, respectively.')
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=thiotepa
- template fit: none — only the metabolite is modelled — no parent compartment
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 4/4 row label(s) assigned, 8 linked by role; re-tagged thiotepa→parent ×4, thiotepa→TEPA ×4
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from abstract in Huitema_2001_metadata.yaml (8 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model
