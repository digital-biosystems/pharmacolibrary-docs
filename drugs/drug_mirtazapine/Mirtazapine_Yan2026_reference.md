# mirtazapine — `Mirtazapine_Yan2026_reference`

> ## <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span>

### Reviewer guidance

**What is wrong:** the reference covariate scenario does not reconstruct

**Steps:**
1. Check covariate_definitions and the reference category in _interpretv2.yaml.

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="mirtazapine" model-id="Mirtazapine_Yan2026_reference" status="rejected" stale="false" population="Chinese patients with depression" measured-compound="mirtazapine" parameterization="apparent" topology="1C"></dbs-pgx>

**Parameterization:** CL/F, V/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — parameter **values are suppressed**. Labels, links and provenance shown for audit only.

The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit. Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit_canonical</code></td><td>the canonical unit for that Q-code, i.e. what value_si is expressed in.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RSE%</code></td><td>relative standard error of the estimate, when the paper reports one.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><td><code>covariates</code></td><td>covariate effects attached to this parameter (e.g. weight on CL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>IIV</code></td><td>inter-individual variability reported for this parameter.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('Θ CL-Fluvoxamine', value '-0.522') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('Θ CL-BMI', value '-0.244') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'PRO' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_1:row8:col1', 'tab_1:row8:col2'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=mirtazapine

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell tab_1:row2:col1 = '1.2 FIX'
- unparsed cell tab_1:row2:col4 = '1.2 FIX'
- unparsed cell tab_1:row3:col5 = '25.423~ 31.343'
- unparsed cell tab_1:row4:col4 = '302.315 191.154~ 462.256'

## Web simulation

> 🚧 Not yet wired up — this tab will host an in-browser run of the model above, with editable parameters and dosing.

The simulator will be built on **bodylight.js**, which compiles a model to WebAssembly and drives it from the page, so a simulation runs entirely in the browser with nothing to install: <https://bodylight.physiome.cz/>
