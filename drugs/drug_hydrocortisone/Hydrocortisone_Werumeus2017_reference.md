<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
</details>

**Model:** A model was generated (see the **Models** tab); it has no in-browser simulator.

### Reviewer guidance

**The clearance plausibility check could not be computed.**

The check had no reference to compare the clearance against, so the value is unverified rather than shown to be wrong. Extracted — hydrocortisone: CL 338 L/h, V 486 L, t1/2z 1 h.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which molecule was measured: this record has cortisol, the second reading hydrocortisone; it also differs on 2 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

<sub>reviewed by rule template (no LLM)</sub>

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `needs_review` (reviewed 2026-09-28 14:38:13.340098+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-04 01:24:43.161319+00:00). Current validate status: `extracted`.

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `hydrocortisone`, measured `cortisol`.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['ka', 'Tlag']
- `apparent_assumption`: F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction (parameterization=apparent)
- `invented_absorption`: ka defaulted — not reported in source
- `input_model`: first-order depot input — apparent (/F) parameterization ⇒ extravascular dosing

**Interpretation flags:**
- column 'monte carlo simulation' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- metabolite cortisol: Q22→Q351 — only the metabolite is measured and fm is not identifiable, so its CL/V are apparent (fm-divided)
- metabolite volume: 'V d (L)' Q63→Q61 for cortisol — it is 1-compartment, so its central volume is its only volume
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=cortisol
- template fit: none — only the metabolite is modelled — no parent compartment
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 3/3 row label(s) assigned, 36 linked by role

**Extraction notes:**
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 1
