# atogepant — `Atogepant_Schlachter2026_phase_1_model`

> ## <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span>

### Reviewer guidance

**What is wrong:** the engineer built the model but a core parameter had no value and was left at its base-class default, so it was not shipped; the engineer did not exercise the covariate scenarios this record defines; the engineer's deviations are not documented and quantified. Evidence: T2_covariates_not_exercised; T6_deviations — got invented_absorption: not acceptable

**Steps:**
1. Check _transcribev2.yaml for the parameter: if the paper's table carries the number, the interpret stage dropped it — re-run interpret and validate for the drug, then the engineer.
2. If the paper never reports it, the record cannot become a model.
3. Advisory only — the base model still replicates.
4. Check the record's covariate_definitions in _interpretv2.yaml.
5. Re-run the engineer for this drug if the covariate curves are wanted.
6. Read the .deviation.json and confirm each deviation names what changed and why.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- covariate level 'Female sex on CL/F' → Q900:female_sex_on_cl_f = -0.19 (linear_fractional on Q27)
- dropped duplicate Q49 ('Famotidine pre-treatment on ka', value '-0.51') — already have one for this compound
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=atogepant
- bound model equation to Q40 (Fab): F = 86.1 * (bodyweight/76.8)^
- Q40 (Fab) is equation-defined: value moved to equation-variable 'F'; equation kept verbatim
- population split: 'phase 1 model' subgroup of Schlachter_2026 (paper reports 3 populations: phase 1 model, phase 2 modela, phase 3 modela)
