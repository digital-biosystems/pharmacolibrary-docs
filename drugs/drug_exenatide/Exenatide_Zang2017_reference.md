### Reviewer guidance

**The paper reports none of the model's key parameters.**

No clearance, volume or rate constant of the model is reported in it. Only the abstract was available, so reported summary statistics stand in for a fitted model. No parameter values were extracted.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss-120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has recombinant exendin-4, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 1 more field. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- table section iiv: 'apparent clearance' routed out of structural estimates ('The interindividual variabilities for CL/F, Vc/F, Ka, and Q/F were 64.4%, 57.7%, 45.5%, and 153.3%, respectively.')
- table section iiv: 'apparent distribution volume of central compartment' routed out of structural estimates ('The interindividual variabilities for CL/F, Vc/F, Ka, and Q/F were 64.4%, 57.7%, 45.5%, and 153.3%, respectively.')
- table section iiv: 'absorption rate constant' routed out of structural estimates ('The interindividual variabilities for CL/F, Vc/F, Ka, and Q/F were 64.4%, 57.7%, 45.5%, and 153.3%, respectively.')
- table section iiv: 'apparent distribution volume of peripheral compartment' routed out of structural estimates ('The interindividual variabilities for CL/F, Vc/F, Ka, and Q/F were 64.4%, 57.7%, 45.5%, and 153.3%, respectively.')
- table section iiv: 'intercompartmental clearance' routed out of structural estimates ('The interindividual variabilities for CL/F, Vc/F, Ka, and Q/F were 64.4%, 57.7%, 45.5%, and 153.3%, respectively.')
- table section iiv: 'interindividual variabilities for CL/F' routed out of structural estimates ('The interindividual variabilities for CL/F, Vc/F, Ka, and Q/F were 64.4%, 57.7%, 45.5%, and 153.3%, respectively.')
- table section iiv: 'interindividual variabilities for Vc/F' routed out of structural estimates ('The interindividual variabilities for CL/F, Vc/F, Ka, and Q/F were 64.4%, 57.7%, 45.5%, and 153.3%, respectively.')
- table section iiv: 'interindividual variabilities for Ka' routed out of structural estimates ('The interindividual variabilities for CL/F, Vc/F, Ka, and Q/F were 64.4%, 57.7%, 45.5%, and 153.3%, respectively.')

- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=exenatide
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model
- review gap-fill skipped: this record carries no value of its own, and a model assembled entirely from other papers is not this paper's model

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from abstract in Zang_2017_metadata.yaml (9 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model
