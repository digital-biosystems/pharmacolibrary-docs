# methylphenidate — `Methylphenidate_Teuscher2015_reference`

> ## <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span>

### Reviewer guidance

> ⚙️ **Pipeline limitation — scholar.** a reported unit is missing from the conversion table, so the parameter reached the engineer without an SI value<br><sub>evidence: `EC50`</sub>

> This is not a curation fix: the record is waiting on the pipeline, not on a reviewer's judgement.

**What is wrong:** no model exists yet, so there is nothing to judge.

**Steps:**
1. Not a curation fix — scholar limitation.
2. No curator action. Run the engineer for this drug.

<sub>owner: **engineer** · guidance written by playbook</sub>

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release multiple-layer beads`, measured `methylphenidate`.

Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit_canonical</code></td><td>the canonical unit for that Q-code, i.e. what value_si is expressed in.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RSE%</code></td><td>relative standard error of the estimate, when the paper reports one.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><td><code>covariates</code></td><td>covariate effects attached to this parameter (e.g. weight on CL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>IIV</code></td><td>inter-individual variability reported for this parameter.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'log likelihood' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_0:row2:col1'])
- dropped duplicate Q320 ('ωE max', value '0.028') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q321 ('ωEC 50', value '1.01') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'ε' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_0:row11:col1'])
- dropped value-less row: 'Ka1'
- dropped value-less row: 'F1'
- dropped value-less row: 'Ka2'
- dropped value-less row: 'tlag'
- dropped value-less row: 'V'
- dropped value-less row: 'CL'
- salvaged Q22 ('CL (L/h)'=1.3) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q61 ('V (L)'=64.7) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q83 ('tlag (h)'=5.75) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=methylphenidate

## Web simulation

> 🚧 Not yet wired up — this tab will host an in-browser run of the model above, with editable parameters and dosing.

The simulator will be built on **bodylight.js**, which compiles a model to WebAssembly and drives it from the page, so a simulation runs entirely in the browser with nothing to install: <https://bodylight.physiome.cz/>
