A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**No value for spironolactone's elimination clearance — all 2 extracted parameters describe 7 alphathiomethylspironolactone, not spironolactone.**

The model was built, but spironolactone's elimination clearance had no value, so a library placeholder stood in and the model was held back rather than published with an invented number. Extracted — 7 alphathiomethylspironolactone: V 103 L, CL 78 L/h.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has spironolactone, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 6 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- implicit units: 'VTMS=VCAN' → L (from the paper text: "The table footnote states: 'VTMS, volume of distribution for TMS (L)'")
- implicit units: 'CLTMS' → L/h (from the paper text: "The table footnote states: 'CLTMS, Clearance for TMS (L/h)'")
- metabolite volume: 'VTMS=VCAN' Q63→Q61 for 7 alphathiomethylspironolactone — it is 1-compartment, so its central volume is its only volume
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=spironolactone
- topology: 2 first-order transfer(s) across 3 compounds → general_linear
- template fit: PK_3M_9C — formed from central; parent 0, metabolites [1, 0]
- population split: 'value 2' subgroup of Lass_2024 (paper reports 2 populations: value 1, value 2)
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 20/20 row label(s) assigned, 30 linked by role; re-tagged parent→canrenone ×12, parent→7 alphathiomethylspironolactone ×18
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is GENERAL_LINEAR (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is GENERAL_LINEAR (peripheral family needs ≥2C)

**Extraction notes:**
- final table tab_0: grid unusable → re-running vision table extraction for Lass_2024
- companion parameter table 2 transcribed (23 record(s))
- companion parameter table 3 transcribed (14 record(s))
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2, 3
