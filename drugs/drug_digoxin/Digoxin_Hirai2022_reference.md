# digoxin — `Digoxin_Hirai2022_reference`

> ## <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span>

### Reviewer guidance

> ⚙️ **Pipeline limitation — scholar.** a reported unit is missing from the conversion table, so the parameter reached the engineer without an SI value<br><sub>evidence: `V/F`, `kabs`</sub>

> This is not a curation fix: the record is waiting on the pipeline, not on a reviewer's judgement.

**What is wrong:** no model exists yet, so there is nothing to judge.

**Steps:**
1. Not a curation fix — scholar limitation.
2. No curator action. Run the engineer for this drug.

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="digoxin" model-id="Digoxin_Hirai2022_reference" status="not_modelled" stale="false" population="Japanese patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure" measured-compound="digoxin" parameterization="apparent" topology="1C"></dbs-pgx>

**Parameterization:** CL/F, V/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `not_modelled`) — parameter **values are suppressed**. Labels, links and provenance shown for audit only.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('CLCR on CL/F', value '0.415') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Amiodarone on CL/F' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab3:row4:col1', 'Tab3:row4:col2', 'Tab3:row4:col3'])
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'fixed' (V/F)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'fixed' (kabs)
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('ωCL/F, %', value '34.2') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Multiplicative, %' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab3:row10:col1', 'Tab3:row10:col2', 'Tab3:row10:col3', 'Tab3:row10:col4'])
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'CL/F' from footnote/prose loose number None (source ['Tab3:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'V/F' from footnote/prose loose number None (source ['Tab3:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'kabs' from footnote/prose loose number 1.0 (source ['Tab3:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=digoxin
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell Tab3:row4:col4 = '−0.246 – − 0.241'
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 3

## Validation

**Reviewer per-scenario checks:**

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T2_covariates | not captured | skipped | not captured | not captured | not captured | no covariate effects in record |
| T3_apparent_invariant | not captured | pass | not captured | F=Fm=1, no molar correction | not captured | apparent params must not be double-corrected |
| T3_param_coverage | not captured | skipped | not captured | not captured | not captured | no emitted model to inspect (engineer build absent) |
| T6_deviations | not captured | pass | not captured | not captured | not captured | no engineer deviations to adjudicate |

## Web simulation

> 🚧 Not yet wired up — this tab will host an in-browser run of the model above, with editable parameters and dosing.

The simulator will be built on **bodylight.js**, which compiles a model to WebAssembly and drives it from the page, so a simulation runs entirely in the browser with nothing to install: <https://bodylight.physiome.cz/>
