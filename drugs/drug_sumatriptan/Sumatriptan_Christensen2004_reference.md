# sumatriptan — `Sumatriptan_Christensen2004_reference`

> ## <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span>

### Reviewer guidance

> ⚙️ **Pipeline limitation — reviewer_tooling.** the check reported a failure without computing a comparison, so this is an inconclusive check rather than a demonstrated fault<br><sub>evidence: `C6_cl_magnitude failed (ratio None)`</sub>

> This is not a curation fix: the record is waiting on the pipeline, not on a reviewer's judgement.

**What is wrong:** clearance is outside the plausible magnitude window.

**Steps:**
1. Not a curation fix — reviewer_tooling limitation.
2. Check the parameter's unit_verbatim — an unconverted per-kg or per-hour unit is the usual cause, not a genuinely extreme value.
3. Confirm value_si against the paper's reported number.
4. A 'ratio None' means the check could not compute a ratio, so treat the window as unverified rather than as a failure of the value.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `needs_review`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit. Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit_canonical</code></td><td>the canonical unit for that Q-code, i.e. what value_si is expressed in.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RSE%</code></td><td>relative standard error of the estimate, when the paper reports one.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><td><code>covariates</code></td><td>covariate effects attached to this parameter (e.g. weight on CL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>IIV</code></td><td>inter-individual variability reported for this parameter.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=sumatriptan
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from abstract in Christensen_2004_metadata.yaml (11 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model
