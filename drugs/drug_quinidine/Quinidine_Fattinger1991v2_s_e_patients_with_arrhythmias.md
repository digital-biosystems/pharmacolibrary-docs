# quinidine — `Quinidine_Fattinger1991v2_s_e_patients_with_arrhythmias`

> ## <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span>

### Reviewer guidance

> ⚙️ **Pipeline limitation — scholar.** a reported unit is missing from the conversion table, so the parameter reached the engineer without an SI value<br><sub>evidence: `CL/F`, `CL`</sub>

> This is not a curation fix: the record is waiting on the pipeline, not on a reviewer's judgement.

**What is wrong:** no model exists yet, so there is nothing to judge.

**Steps:**
1. Not a curation fix — scholar limitation.
2. No curator action. Run the engineer for this drug.

## Validation

**Reviewer per-scenario checks:**

| check | scenario | status | expected | obtained | ratio | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T2_covariates | not captured | skipped | not captured | not captured | not captured | no covariate effects in record |
| T3_apparent_invariant | not captured | pass | not captured | F=Fm=1, no molar correction | not captured | apparent params must not be double-corrected |
| T3_param_coverage | not captured | skipped | not captured | not captured | not captured | no emitted model to inspect (engineer build absent) |
| T6_deviations | not captured | pass | not captured | not captured | not captured | no engineer deviations to adjudicate |

## Web simulation

> 🚧 Not yet wired up — this tab will host an in-browser run of the model above, with editable parameters and dosing.

The simulator will be built on **bodylight.js**, which compiles a model to WebAssembly and drives it from the page, so a simulation runs entirely in the browser with nothing to install: <https://bodylight.physiome.cz/>
