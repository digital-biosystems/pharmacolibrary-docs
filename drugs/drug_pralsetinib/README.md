## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Jade_2023 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a computational study on virtual screening for SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibition and contains no pharmacokinetic parameters for pralsetinib. |
| popPK | Kassir_2024 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on exposure-response relationships for efficacy and safety (PFS, AEs) rather than reporting quantitative pharmacokinetic disposition parameters like clearance, volume, or half-life. |
