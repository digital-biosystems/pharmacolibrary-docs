# morphine — `Morphine_Yalcin2022_reference`

> ## <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span>

### Reviewer guidance

**What is wrong:** the engineer built the model but a core parameter had no value and was left at its base-class default, so it was not shipped

**Steps:**
1. Check _transcribev2.yaml for the parameter: if the paper's table carries the number, the interpret stage dropped it — re-run interpret and validate for the drug, then the engineer.
2. If the paper never reports it, the record cannot become a model.

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="morphine" model-id="Morphine_Yalcin2022_reference" status="model_quarantined" stale="false" population="critically ill neonates and infants undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation" measured-compound="unknown" parameterization="mechanistic" topology="1C"></dbs-pgx>

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `model_quarantined`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

_No resolved parameters._

### Unresolved rows _(no Q-code or no value — not parameters)_
| label (paper) | Q-code | value | link |
|---|---|---|---|
| Modality Administered dose Vd | Q61 | not captured | boundary |

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 't 1/2 (hours) Recommended dose' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_11:row0:col3', 'tab_11:row0:col4'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=unknown
- gap-filled Q22 (CL) from Bardol_2025's review values (primary lacked it)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- removed gap-filled parent disposition (Q22): this record measures 'unknown', not morphine, and reports no metabolite CL/V — the imported values describe a compartment this record did not measure

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell tab_11:row1:col3 = '↓38%'
- unparsed cell tab_11:row2:col4 = '↑40%'
- unparsed cell tab_11:row3:col1 = 'Children 1-compartment'
- unparsed cell tab_11:row4:col2 = '1 group compared'
- unparsed cell tab_11:row5:col1 = '3.3±0.5 for'
- unparsed cell tab_11:row5:col3 = '4.8±2.0 for'
- unparsed cell tab_11:row6:col1 = '8.4±5.9 for'
- unparsed cell tab_11:row6:col3 = '122±107 for'
- unparsed cell tab_11:row7:col1 = 'N: 38'
- unparsed cell tab_11:row7:col2 = 'I: 14'
- unparsed cell tab_11:row8:col2 = 'al, 37 UK'

## Validation

**Scholar closed-form checks:**

| check | status | expected | obtained | ratio | tol | source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C0_has_structural_params | pass | not captured | 1 | not captured | not captured | not captured |
| C0b_disposition_core | pass | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured |
| C5_dimension_Q22 | pass | [length] ** 3 / [time] | not captured | not captured | not captured | ['Bardol_2025:review'] |
| C6_cl_magnitude | pass | &lt;= 90.0 L/h | 28.0 | not captured | not captured | ['Bardol_2025:review'] |
| C8_topology | pass | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured |
| C9_phys_window_Q22 | pass | clearance within physiological range | 28 L/h | not captured | not captured | ['Bardol_2025:review'] |

**Reviewer per-scenario checks:**

| check | scenario | status | expected | obtained | ratio | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T2_covariates | not captured | skipped | not captured | not captured | not captured | no covariate effects in record |
| T3_param_coverage | not captured | skipped | not captured | not captured | not captured | no structural disposition parameters in record |
| T3_topology_template | not captured | pass | 1C → PK_1C* | PK_1C | not captured | engineer template must match the scholar topology |
| T6_deviations | not captured | pass | not captured | all deviations documented+quantified | not captured | LLM adjudication → deterministic rule |
| T1_cmin_ss | reference | skipped | not captured | not captured | not captured | no simulated metric for this quantity (single reference sim) |
