## About

Zavegepant is a CGRP antagonist used as an antimigraine medicine for the acute treatment of migraine attacks. It is an approved active ingredient, though it is not authorised in the European Union and appears to be used mainly in the United States.

<small>Summary written by `glm-5.3-flash` from [Wikidata Q99388898](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q99388898) and the WHO ATC classification; not checked by a person.</small>

## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.

<summary>Badge legend — what each badge means</summary>
<table><thead><tr><th>badge</th><th>what it means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">curated</span></td><td>hand-authored by a person — an exemplar, not an extraction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">extracted</span></td><td>the pipeline accepted the record: every closed-form check it could run passed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">reviewed — candidate</span></td><td>the reviewer ran the built model against the paper's own reported values and they agree — the best automatic verdict there is.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">accepted (caveats)</span></td><td>the model replicates the paper, but an advisory check failed — the record page names the caveat under the badge and the drug page shows it under the status.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span></td><td>extracted, then a check failed or a value looks implausible. The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field. With more than one reader the badge counts them, e.g. 'cross-checked ✓ 2/2'.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">cross-check: partial</span></td><td>a reader differs on a non-structural field (a population label, a flag), or the readers do not all agree with each other.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">cross-check: disputed</span></td><td>at least one reader differs on a structural parameter — a clearance, a volume, ka, a lag. The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people. The record, its model and its simulation are kept — they describe that species.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PD | Bhardwaj_2024 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports only pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters (AUC, Cmax) and safety data; it does not report any pharmacodynamic (PD) or exposure-response relationship. |
| PGx | Bhardwaj_2024_2 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The study reports pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with rifampin and itraconazole, not pharmacogenomic effects based on genetic variants. |
| popPK | Hughes_2024 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The study is a cardiac safety assessment focusing on QTc interval and concentration-QTc relationship, not a pharmacokinetic study reporting quantitative disposition parameters like clearance or volume of distribution. |
| PGx | Lipton_2026 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a clinical review comparing triptans and gepants and does not report pharmacogenomic variants or their effects on zavegepant's PK/PD parameters. |
| PGx | Takizawa_2023 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a narrative review regarding drug-drug interactions between gepants and COVID-19 treatments (Paxlovid), not a study on pharmacogenomic variants affecting zavegepant PK/PD. |
| PD | unknown_2023 | not_relevant | 1 | 0 | The text is a title or brief mention of "Drugs for migraine" without providing any specific data, models, or numeric parameters for zavegepant. |
| PD | unknown_2023_2 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The provided text is only a title and does not contain any data, analysis, or numeric parameters regarding pharmacodynamics or exposure-response relationships. |
