> **Species: rat.** This record comes from an animal study (rat), not from people. The values, the model and its simulation are shown as the paper reports them — they describe that system, not human pharmacology (read from the LLM relevance screen, p(non-human) 1.00).

**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**The salmeterol model was quarantined because bioavailability (F), clearance (Cl), volume of distribution (Vd) and the central-to-peripheral rate constant (k12) had no extracted values and library defaults were used instead.**

The record concerns salmeterol in rats after intravenous administration, but the parameters actually extracted with values (CL 3.37 L/h/kg, V1 0.223 L/kg, Q 4.72 L/h/kg, V2 2.41 L/kg, Kp 5.21, Qb 0.777 L/h/kg) belong to fluticasone propionate, not salmeterol. For salmeterol only an absorption rate constant (kabs −0.89 h−1) and an absorption lag time (tlag 1.5 h) were recorded. The deviations check failed because defaulted parameters were used in place of explicit estimates, so the model was held back rather than published with invented numbers. Extracted — fluticasone propionate: CL 3.37 L/h/kg, V1 0.223 L/kg, Q 4.72 L/h/kg, V2 2.41 L/kg, Kp 5.21, Qb 0.777 L/h/kg; salmeterol: kabs -0.89 h−1, tlag 1.5 h.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss-120b`) disagrees on the value of absorption lag gut: this record has 1.5, the second reading none; it also differs on 1 more field. That field does not shape the model.
