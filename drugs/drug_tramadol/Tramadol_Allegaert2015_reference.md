# tramadol — `Tramadol_Allegaert2015_reference`

> ## <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span>

### Reviewer guidance

**What is wrong:** the engineer built the model but a core parameter had no value and was left at its base-class default, so it was not shipped; the engineer's deviations are not documented and quantified. Evidence: T6_deviations — got defaulted_parameters: structural deviation not quantified

**Steps:**
1. Check _transcribev2.yaml for the parameter: if the paper's table carries the number, the interpret stage dropped it — re-run interpret and validate for the drug, then the engineer.
2. If the paper never reports it, the record cannot become a model.
3. Read the .deviation.json and confirm each deviation names what changed and why.
4. Anything undocumented needs the engineer, not a curator.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=tramadol
- topology: transfer parameter unlinked (Q100) — add Kfm/formation-rate/rate-constant to the ontology; routing to review
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- gap-filled Q22 (CL) from Ekstrand_2026's review values (primary lacked it)
- gap-filled Q61 (V) from Ekstrand_2026's review values (primary lacked it)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is PARENT_METABOLITE (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is PARENT_METABOLITE (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- gap-filled Q49 (kabs) from Ekstrand_2026's review values (primary lacked it)

**Extraction notes:**
- no TEI final-model table id; trying text-pointer table recovery
- text-pointer recovery found no readable extracted parameter table

| T3_param_coverage | not captured | pass | 3 scholar param(s) emitted or defaulted | 3 covered | not captured | all structural parameters accounted for |
| T3_topology_template | not captured | pass | parent_metabolite → PK_Parent_Metabolite* | PK_Parent_Metabolite | not captured | engineer template must match the scholar topology |
| T6_deviations | not captured | fail | not captured | defaulted_parameters: structural deviation not quantified | not captured | LLM adjudication → deterministic rule |
