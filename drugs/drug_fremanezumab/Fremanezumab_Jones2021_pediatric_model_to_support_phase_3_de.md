### Reviewer guidance

**What is wrong:** no model exists yet, so there is nothing to judge; the engineer did not exercise the covariate scenarios this record defines. Evidence: T2_covariates_not_exercised

**Steps:**
1. No curator action. Run the engineer for this drug.
2. Advisory only — the base model still replicates.
3. Check the record's covariate_definitions in _interpretv2.yaml.
4. Re-run the engineer for this drug if the covariate curves are wanted.

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="fremanezumab" model-id="Fremanezumab_Jones2021_pediatric_model_to_support_phase_3_de" status="not_modelled" stale="false" population="pediatric patients with migraine" measured-compound="" parameterization="" topology=""></dbs-pgx>

**Parameterization:** not captured.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `not_modelled`) — parameter **values are suppressed**. Labels, links and provenance shown for audit only.

_No resolved parameters._

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['F', 'ka', 'Tlag']
- `invented_absorption`: ka defaulted — not reported in source

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'VOF' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['pharmaceutics-13-00785-t001:row17:col2'])
- covariate effect for Q319 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- covariate effect for Q319 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=fremanezumab
- population split: 'pediatric model to support phase 3 development 1' subgroup of Jones_2021 (paper reports 2 populations: pediatric model to support phase 3 development 1, previously developed adult model applied to pediatric data)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 1
- skipped illustrative/example figure caption(s) pharmaceutics-13-00785-f001 — per-individual fit, not model parameters

## Validation

**Reviewer per-scenario checks:**

| check | scenario | status | expected | obtained | ratio | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T2_covariates_not_exercised | (all) | fail | not captured | not captured | not captured | record has covariate_effects but the engineer simulated only the reference individual — covariate scenarios were not exercised |
| T3_param_coverage | not captured | skipped | not captured | not captured | not captured | no emitted model to inspect (engineer build absent) |
| T6_deviations | not captured | pass | not captured | not captured | not captured | no engineer deviations to adjudicate |

## Downloadable models

Each archive holds the model source, a script that simulates it against the appropriate library, and a README describing both and how to run them.

**FMI is two downloads.** The archive holds this record's parameters and its driver; the simulator itself is `PK_2C_enteral.fmu`, one compiled template shared by every model of this structure. Take the FMU once, keep it beside the script (or pass `--fmu PATH`). Running it reproduces the model-specific FMU exactly.

## Web simulation

> 🚧 Not yet wired up — this tab will host an in-browser run of the model above, with editable parameters and dosing.

The simulator will be built on **bodylight.js**, which compiles a model to WebAssembly and drives it from the page, so a simulation runs entirely in the browser with nothing to install: <https://bodylight.physiome.cz/>
