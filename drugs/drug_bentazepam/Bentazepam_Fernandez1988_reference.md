**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**The bentazepam record was quarantined because bioavailability, clearance, absorption lag time, and the intercompartmental rate constants k12 and k21 had no extracted values and library placeholders stood in for them.**

Although the abstract of Fernandez_1988 reports bentazepam values for absorption rate constant (2.024 h-1), volumes of distribution (2.198 and 2.049 l/kg), elimination rate constant (0.13 h-1) and the transfer rate constants k12 (0.042 h-1) and k21 (0.103 h-1), the record's bioavailability, clearance, absorption lag time, k12 and k21 had no value, so placeholders stood in instead of explicit estimates. The record was built from the paper's abstract alone, meaning summary statistics stood in for a fitted model. The failed deviations check returned 'defaulted_parameters: not acceptable', and the model was held back rather than published with invented numbers. Extracted — bentazepam: kabs 2.02 h-1, V 2.2 l/kg, kel 0.13 h-1, V1 2.05 l/kg, k12 0.042 h-1, k21 0.103 h-1.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss-120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has bentazepam, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 13 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped duplicate Q47 ('K10', value 0.154) — already have one for this compound
- apparent-by-design (ADVISORY, codes unchanged): extravascular dosing with no identifiable F, so these reported disposition parameters are likely apparent unless the model puts first-pass in its structure — Q61 (Vd); Q63 (Vc)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=bentazepam
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from abstract in Fernandez_1988_metadata.yaml (8 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model
