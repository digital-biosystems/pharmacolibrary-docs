A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**Phenol's bioavailability, clearance, and absorption lag time lacked extracted values, so placeholders were used and the model was quarantined.**

The record contains no values for phenol's bioavailability, clearance, or absorption lag time, resulting in the use of library placeholders. The model was built from the abstract alone, so summary statistics stood in for a fitted model. A second reader disagreed on the assignment of the phenyl glucuronide clearance constant and the glucuronidation rate. Extracted — phenyl glucuronide: CL 15.7 ml/kg/h, kfm 0.049 /h; phenol: V 2.66e+03 L, kabs 0.0069 min-1.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has phenol, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 9 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=phenol
- template fit: PK_3M_9C — formed from central; parent 0, metabolites [0]
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 2/2 row label(s) assigned, 2 linked by role; re-tagged phenol→phenyl glucuronide ×2
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model
- gap-filled Q61 (V) from Thoueille_2023's review values (primary lacked it)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is PARENT_METABOLITE (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is PARENT_METABOLITE (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- gap-filled Q49 (kabs) from Nishida_1995's review values (primary lacked it)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from abstract in Nichols_2008_metadata.yaml (2 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model
