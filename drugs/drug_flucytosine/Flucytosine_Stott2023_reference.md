<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The flucytosine model's terminal half-life is 0.452 h versus the paper's 14.5 h (ratio 0.0312), and the distribution micro-rate constant kcomp (31.97 h⁻¹) was not carried into the model, so it was held for review.**

Simulated as the paper dosed it, the model's terminal half-life (0.452 h) differs from the reported 14.5 h by far more than the tolerance, indicating the parameterization does not reproduce the paper's disposition. Of the four extracted parameters, only three were emitted; kcomp, the micro-rate constant governing distribution between kinetic compartments, was neither emitted nor defaulted. The builder also left the absorption lag time (Tlag) at library placeholder defaults and assumed F=1 and Fm=1 with no molar correction, so all parameters are apparent (CL/F, V/F). Extracted — flucytosine: kabs 102 h -1, CL/F 56.9 L/h, V/F 57.1 L, kcomp 32 h -1.

Independently confirmed by `gpt-oss:120b`.
