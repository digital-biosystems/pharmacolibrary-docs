<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The citalopram (escitalopram) record was rejected because the model was built as a one-compartment PK model instead of the required three-compartment parent–metabolite structure, the output was not the measured escitalopram compartment, the k12 transfer constant (0.73 h⁻¹) was not extracted, and Vss (1310 L) was substituted for the central distribution volume.**

The paper's structure is parent–metabolite with a three-compartment PK model, but the record used a one-compartment model, so the S-desmethylcitalopram metabolism link (Kfm) and the metabolite output could not be represented; the output was set to the central parent compartment rather than the measured escitalopram compartment. Parameter coverage expected 2 parameters but only 1 was covered, with k12 (0.73 h⁻¹) neither emitted nor defaulted. The builder used Vss (1310 L) as the distribution volume because no central volume was reported, which reproduces AUC and terminal half-life but not the early distribution phase; this substitution was judged not acceptable. The residual error σ of 35.3% and clearance CL of 28.7 L/h were reported, but the structure and deviation checks failed. Extracted — citalopram: CL 28.7 L/h, Vss 1.31e+03 L, k12 0.73 h⁻¹, k31 0.54 h⁻¹, sigma 35.3.

**Model structure:** —; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 0 extracted.

**Parameterization:** not captured.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `not captured`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

_No resolved parameters._

## Departures & gaps

_None recorded._

## Validation

**Reviewer per-scenario checks:**

| check | scenario | status | expected | obtained | ratio | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T0_analyte_identity | not captured | pass | not captured | not captured | not captured | V/CL labels are the drug's (or a metabolite's), no biomarker signal |
| T2_covariates | not captured | skipped | not captured | not captured | not captured | no covariate effects in record |
| T3_output_variable | not captured | fail | Metabolite_C (measured=escitalopram) | central.C | not captured | output must be the measured/analyte compartment |
| T3_param_coverage | not captured | fail | 2 scholar param(s) emitted or defaulted | 1 covered | not captured | neither emitted nor in defaulted[]: ['k12'] |
| T3_rate_constant_conversion | not captured | pass | Kfm (rate_constant) → CL = k·V | no explicit k·V edge found in model | not captured | rate constant must not be used raw as a clearance |
| T3_topology_template | not captured | fail | parent_metabolite → PK_3M_9C* | PK_1C | not captured | engineer template must match the scholar topology |
| T6_deviations | not captured | fail | not captured | vss_as_v: not acceptable | not captured | LLM adjudication → deterministic rule |
