<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

### Reviewer guidance

**Why:** C9 clearance/volume outside physiological window (implausible magnitude — unit/scale extraction error)
**How to address:** read the paper and record the missing values by hand, or leave the record rejected — there is nothing here to build.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit_canonical</code></td><td>the canonical unit for that Q-code, i.e. what value_si is expressed in.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RSE%</code></td><td>relative standard error of the estimate, when the paper reports one.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><td><code>covariates</code></td><td>covariate effects attached to this parameter (e.g. weight on CL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>IIV</code></td><td>inter-individual variability reported for this parameter.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- column 'bootstrap' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- apparent-by-design (ADVISORY, codes unchanged): extravascular dosing with no identifiable F, so these reported disposition parameters are likely apparent unless the model puts first-pass in its structure — Q61 (V (mL)); Q22 (CL (mL/h))
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=granisetron

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell T3:row7:col1 = '4.74078E-11 (149.10549)'
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 3
