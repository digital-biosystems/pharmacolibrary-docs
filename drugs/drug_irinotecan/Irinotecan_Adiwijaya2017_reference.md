# irinotecan — `Irinotecan_Adiwijaya2017_reference`

> ## <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span>

### Reviewer guidance

> ⚙️ **Pipeline limitation — engineer.** parent/metabolite records are not currently produced as models — the composite builds but does not survive simulation<br><sub>evidence: `topology_template=parent_metabolite`</sub>

> This is not a curation fix: the record is waiting on the pipeline, not on a reviewer's judgement.

**What is wrong:** no model exists yet, so there is nothing to judge.

**Steps:**
1. Not a curation fix — engineer limitation.
2. No curator action. Run the engineer for this drug.

<sub>owner: **engineer** · guidance written by playbook</sub>

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `liposomal irinotecan`, measured `total irinotecan`.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `not_modelled`) — parameter **values are suppressed**. Labels, links and provenance shown for audit only.

| label (paper) | Q-code · name | value | unit | value_si | unit_canonical | RSE% | link | source | covariates | IIV |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- salvaged Q22 ('estimated clearance difference'=0.0) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=total irinotecan
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell tab_1:row1:col2 = 'Q2W b'
- unparsed cell tab_1:row1:col3 = 'Q3W b'
- unparsed cell tab_1:row2:col2 = '1.19 (0.91-1.55)'
- unparsed cell tab_1:row2:col3 = '1.66 (1.33-2.05)'
- unparsed cell tab_1:row8:col2 = '0.721 (0.667-0.778)'
- unparsed cell tab_1:row8:col3 = '0.870 (0.821-0.922)'
- unparsed cell tab_1:row12:col2 = '0.589 (0.543-0.639)'
- unparsed cell tab_1:row12:col3 = '0.702 (0.661-0.745)'

## Web simulation

> 🚧 Not yet wired up — this tab will host an in-browser run of the model above, with editable parameters and dosing.

The simulator will be built on **bodylight.js**, which compiles a model to WebAssembly and drives it from the page, so a simulation runs entirely in the browser with nothing to install: <https://bodylight.physiome.cz/>
