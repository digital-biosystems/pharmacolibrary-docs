> **Species: rat.** This record comes from an animal study (rat), not from people. The values, the model and its simulation are shown as the paper reports them — they describe that system, not human pharmacology (read from the LLM relevance screen, p(non-human) 1.00).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The two-compartment indocyanine green model for Fischer rats with adenocarcinoma tumors was rejected because a compartment is unreachable or orphaned, i.e. not connected to the dose path.**

The record describes a two-compartment indocyanine green model with an absorption rate constant kabs of 6.90 1/s, an elimination rate constant kel of 4.93 1/s, a central volume V1 of 30.4 L and a peripheral volume V2 of 4.84 L. The rejection is based on model structure: a compartment has no path from the dose, making it unreachable or orphaned. No other failed checks or builder deviations are reported. Extracted — indocyanine green: kabs 6.9 1/s, kel 4.93 1/s, V1 30.4 L, V2 4.84 L.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss-120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has indocyanine green, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 3 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped PD-category row 'k_out(sec^{-1}) (10^{-3})' → Q328 (kout, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['Alacam_2005_table_2:row2:col3'])
- implicit units: 'k_a(sec^{-1}) (10^{-2})' → 1/s (from the paper text: 'Table II lists the parameter as "k_a(sec^{-1}) (10^{-2})", i.e., the absorption rate constant is expressed in sec^{-1} (')
- implicit units: 'k_b(sec^{-1}) (10^{-2})' → 1/s (from the paper text: 'Table II lists the parameter as "k_b(sec^{-1}) (10^{-2})", i.e., the elimination rate constant is expressed in sec^{-1} ')
- implicit units: 'v_i (10^{-2})' → L (from the popPK convention: 'The paper gives no unit for v_i (V1, volume of distribution of the central compartment); volumes of distribution in popu')
- implicit units: 'v_p (10^{-2})' → L (from the popPK convention: 'The paper gives no unit for v_p (V2, volume of distribution of the peripheral compartment); compartmental volumes are co')
- apparent-by-design (ADVISORY, codes unchanged): extravascular dosing with no identifiable F, so these reported disposition parameters are likely apparent unless the model puts first-pass in its structure — Q63 (v_i (10^{-2})); Q64 (v_p (10^{-2}))
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=indocyanine green
- population split: 'rat 3' subgroup of Alacam_2005 (paper reports 4 populations: rat 1, rat 2, rat 3, rat 4)
- skipped review gap-fill of CL: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- no TEI final-model table id; trying text-pointer table recovery
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2
- transposed table Alacam_2005_table_2: parameters were across the columns, populations/subgroups down the first column — transposed for parsing
